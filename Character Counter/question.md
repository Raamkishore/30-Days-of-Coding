Count the number of characters from 1 to n digits.

For example,

If the input n is 6, we have numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

We have 6 unit digits. So, total character equals 6.

If the input is 12, we have numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.

We have 9 unit digits and 3 double digits. Each double digit has 2 characters in it. So, total character equals 15.
