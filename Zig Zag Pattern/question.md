# Zig Zag Pattern

Your program should take a string 'n' and integer 'm' as input.

Form a matrix of size m*m with asterisks '*\'

Conditions to modify the matrix :

1) Last asterisk of the first row should be replaced with the first character of the string.

2) First two asterisks of the second row should be replaced with the next two characters of the string.

3) In this same fashion, other rows of the matrix should be modified.

4) If there are no characters left in the string, you can replace those asterisks with the hash symbol '#'

Print the modified output
